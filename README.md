TestableUIKit
=============

This is a framework that uses the same class names as some classes from UIKit and extends them using the fully qualified name of the real class.  This allows for a *shim* layer between your application code and UIKit **only while testing**.

Much, much more will be coming shortly.  For now, here is what the framework contains:

[[UIViewController]]
 - [Superclass calls](UIViewControllerSuperCalls.md)
 - [Other calls](UIViewControllerCalls.md)

 [[UIView]]
 - [Superclass calls](UIViewSuperCalls.md)
